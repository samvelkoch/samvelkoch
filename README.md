#### Hi there and welcome! 😇


I'm getting into the data science, statistics and machine learning topics. The only thing that drives me is an exorbitant, epistemic curiosity and passion to learn and apply new things.

Here is my public sandbox, a modest 'pride shelf' and a collection of naive code bluppers.

Also I'm a Professional Data Analyst and Associate Data Scientist certified by DataCamp but I have never work in this roles. At the moment I'm trying to land my first Data job. Behind current data passion I have extensive experiences in digital projects management for NGOs, HIV/AIDS field projects and international development conferences. 

I have pair of hobbies: Speedcubing and Books
